### Introduction
The purpose of the interformational flow (IFF) project is to improve our understanding of groundwater that recharges the Edwards Aquifer (EA) from the Trinity Aquifer (TA). Estimates of recharge will be based on detailed conceptual models of the interface between the two aqufiers.
### Characteristics of the Conceptual Models
| Characteristic   | Description   |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Stratigraphy   | Detailed model of rock units obtained from well logs, geologic maps, etc. |
| Structure      | Faults from geologic maps and reports. Determine if faults act as barriers or conduits for groundwater flow. |
| Potentiometric Surface | Groundwater elevations for each hydrostratigraphic unit. |
| Surface Water Input | Surface water flow extremes and estimates of net recharge. |
| Meteorology | Precipitation, solar radiation, wind, etc to calculate evapotranspiration (ET). |
| Soil | Measurements of soil moisture from weather stations. |
| Storm Response | Response of groundwater, surface water, and soil moisture to a storm event. |
| Groundwater Flow Paths | Principal flow paths connecting the Trinity to the Edwards. |
| Groundwater Chemistry | Water quality analyses from wells, springs, and surface water. |

### Water Balance
Water balances for the Edwards and Trinity aquifers consist of water added to the system from precipitation (P), surface water losses (SWin), and groundwater inflows (GWin) balanced by water leaving the system via surface water (SWout), groundwater outflows (GWout), and evapotranspiration (ET).

**Trinity Aquifer**  
P<sub>TA</sub> + SWin<sub>TA</sub> + GWin<sub>TA</sub> = ET<sub>TA</sub> + SWout<sub>TA</sub> + GWout<sub>TA</sub> + SPout<sub>TA</sub> + &Delta;Storage  
**Edwards Aquifer**  
P<sub>EA</sub> + SWin<sub>EA</sub> + GWin<sub>EA</sub> = ET<sub>EA</sub> + SWout<sub>EA</sub> + GWout<sub>EA</sub> + &Delta;Storage  

_By adding these equations, the precipitation and ET components may be combined for the region, and the interformational flow component, GWin<sub>EA</sub> (GWout<sub>TA</sub>) can be calculated._  

P + SWin<sub>TA</sub> + SWin<sub>EA</sub> + GWin<sub>TA</sub> + GWin<sub>EA</sub> = ET + SWout<sub>TA</sub> + SWout<sub>EA</sub> + &Delta;Storage  

_Finally,_  

GWin<sub>EA</sub> = ET + SWout<sub>TA</sub> + SWout<sub>EA</sub> - P - SWin<sub>TA</sub> - SWin<sub>EA</sub> - GWin<sub>TA</sub> + &Delta;Storage
### Hypotheses
The following are general hypotheses that may or may not be relevant for each study area:
* Recharge occurs during precipitation events
* Faults are barriers (or high transmissivity zones) to interformational flow
* Recharge occurs only while soil moisture conditions exceed some threshold value
* Interformational flow only occurs where the Cow Creek Limestone is juxtaposed against the Edwards Limestone
* There are multiple groundwater stratigraphic units in the Trinity Aquifer
* Surface water losses (or groundwater flows) are the principal source of interformational flow
* Brackish water in the Trinity Aquifer is isolated from the principal groundwater flowpaths
